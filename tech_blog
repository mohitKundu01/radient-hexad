36 hours,

 36 hours of my life were devoted to Techacks 4.0. I had to prepare for 
 my end-term examination and get ready for a cultural event, but I chose to 
 stay and invest my time in this hackathon. Was it worth it? Every single 
 second I spent here was worth it. I learned a great amount of information 
 and had the opportunity to tap into a vast amount of knowledge I was never 
 aware of. We had highly intellectual mentors who helped us at every single 
 step. Every team member I came across in this beautiful hackathon always had 
 a smile on their face and was always ready to help.

Speaking of the food they provided, it never made me feel like I was away from home. 
The campus, the weather, and the crowdâ€”everything was just mesmerizing. On our first 
night, when we participants were under immense pressure to meet the goals, the event 
organizers helped us in every way possible. We played games like archery, hoola-hoop, 
and a kind of tennis. We had friendly competitions between team members in archery games, 
and all of us had loads of fun.

The best part came when we were introduced to the silent DJ activity. Coincidentally, it was 
also on my bucket list, and I felt so satisfied crossing it off because it was so much fun! We 
were totally refreshed with the dance that we forgot we had been up for almost 15-16 hours. Not 
just the dance, but we also enjoyed the jamming session. Overall, it was a great experience. I 
had the most fun experience in these last 36 hours
